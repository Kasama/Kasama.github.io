{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello World!"
#=> Hello World!
{% endhighlight %}

As it is a tradition among programmers, whenever a new project is started, the
first to do is to print the infamous "Hello World!" string.

The Blog
--------

This blog is about Software Development, Tools, Frameworks, Programming
Languages, Tutorials and anything else related to Computer Science and
Technology.

My plan is to run this blog in a collaborative fashion, so if you want to
publish a post that might fit in here, you can do so by opening a pull request
on the [Github](https://github.com/Kasama/kasama.github.io) page for this site.
The blog is powered by the [Jekyll][jekyll] static page generation
engine, so it's possible to write posts in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
and have the [Jekyll][jekyll] engine do the heavy lifting of creating a page for it.

About Me
--------

My name is Roberto, I'm a Brazilian Computer Scientist, software developer, and
technology enthusiast.

My main areas of expertise are Web development, Linux Systems, Infrastructure
and automation.

Language
--------

My mother tongue is Portuguese, but I find that, by writing the blog posts in
English, I'll be able to reach a broader audience. Although there may be an
occasional Portuguese post.
